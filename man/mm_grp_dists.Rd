\usage{
mm_grp_dists(dat, grps, plots = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{a 2d matrix of data. Presumably PC scores}

\item{grps}{a vector defining group IDs}

\item{plots}{Logical. Should distances be plotted as boxplots? If FALSE, distance calculations are still performed}
}
\value{
A list containing individual distances from the sample mean shape. If
\code{plots=TRUE}, will also visualize results
}
\description{
Calculate and plot group distance from centroid (grand mean)
