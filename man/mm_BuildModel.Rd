\title{Build, implement, visualize multivariate linear model.}
\usage{
mm_BuildModel(shape_data, ..., subgrps = NULL, ff1 = NULL, univ_series = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{shape_data}{This will be the (multivariate) response variable}

\item{...}{Covariate(s)/classifier(s) to build a model set. Individual models
are run with interaction effects.}

\item{subgrps}{Optional. Vector of group membership. Model sets will be run
across the whole sample and subgroups. If k is specified, only the full
model will be run.}

\item{ff1}{An explicit model to test in the format: " coords ~ ...". Names
must match those specifed in \code{...}. Standard lm notation applies.}

\item{univ_series}{Default (FALSE) will evaluate multiple covariates and their
interaction in a single model. However, it can be helpful to understand the
univariate effects in isolation of interaction/confounding factors. Set
\code{univ_series=TRUE} to produce a series of model sets, one for each covariate
specified (NOTE: ff1 must also be NULL for this to work).}
}
\value{
A list containing output of one or more multivariate linear models
that can be inspected on their own or interacted with using \link{mm_VizModel}
or \link{mm_CompModel}.
}
\description{
Easily evaluate simple model sets (one covariate with up to 2 additional
classifiers/covariates). Helpful for exploratory analysis. For detailed
models or specific combinations of variables, see \link[geomorph:procD.lm]{geomorph::procD.lm}
for full use of this function.
