Description: Mitteroecker & Gunz (2009) <doi:10.1007/s11692-009-9055-x> describe
    how geometric morphometric methods allow researchers to quantify the size
    and shape of physical biological structures. We provide tools to extend geometric
    morphometric principles to the study of non-physical structures, hormone profiles, 
    as outlined in Ehrlich et al (2021) <doi:10.1002/ajpa.24514>. Easily transform 
    daily measures into multivariate landmark-based data. Includes custom functions 
    to apply multivariate methods for data exploration as well as hypothesis testing. 
    Also includes 'shiny' web app to streamline data exploration. Developed to study 
    menstrual cycle hormones but functions have been generalized and should be 
    applicable to any biomarker over any time period.
